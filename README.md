## Specs
| Term  | Description | Implementation |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| border-box | This property tells the browser what parts of the box model should be included in the elements total width and height. |
|float | The float property specifies whether or not a box, like an element, should float. |
|display: block | The display: block property  displays an element as a block element like a (<p>) tag |
|display: inline | The display: inline property is the default value and displays an element as an inline element like a span tag |
| span | The (<span>) tag is used to group inline-elements in a document, it provides no visual change by itself, and the tag provides a way to add a hook to a part of a text or a part of a document. |
|centered content: text Align| The (<center>) tag is used to center-align text. |
|pseudo-element |  CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element. |
|pseudo-class | A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element. |
|clear-fix | A clearfix is a way for an element to automatically clear its child elements, so that you don't need to add additional markup. |
|positional selector | In CSS, selectors are patterns used to select the element(s) you want to style. |
|selector combinator |  A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator such as descendant selector (space) child selector (>) adjacent sibling selector (+) and a general sibling selector (~) |
